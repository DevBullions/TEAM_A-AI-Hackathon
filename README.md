# Tourism Chatbot

This application utilizes the Google Generative AI API to create a tourism chatbot. Users can ask questions about their destination, and the chatbot provides responses based on the selected model. The user interface is built using Streamlit.

## Setup

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```
   pip install google-generativeai streamlit
   ```

2. Set up access to the Google Generative AI API by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your API key.

3. Run the application by executing the Python script `vvv.py`.

## Usage

1. Upon running the application, the user is presented with a selection box to choose the model for the chatbot.

2. After selecting the model, the user can input their question about the destination in the provided text input field.

3. Clicking the "Ask" button triggers the chatbot to respond with relevant information about the destination.

4. The chatbot response, along with any budget information, is displayed to the user.

## Functionality

- The application initializes the selected model from the available models retrieved using the Google Generative AI API.

- Users can interact with the chatbot by asking questions about their destination.

- The chatbot handles errors gracefully and retries the request in case of failures.

- Budget information is extracted from the chatbot response and displayed along with the response text.
